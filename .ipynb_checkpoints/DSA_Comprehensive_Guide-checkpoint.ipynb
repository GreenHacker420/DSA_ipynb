    "The Prefix Sum technique is a powerful method used to efficiently perform range sum queries on arrays. It's particularly useful when you need to calculate the sum of elements in a given range multiple times. Instead of recalculating the sum for each query (which would be O(n) per query), we precompute a prefix sum array that allows us to perform range sum queries in O(1) time.\n",

    "Arrays are fundamental data structures that store elements in contiguous memory locations. They provide efficient access to elements using indices but may have limitations when it comes to insertions and deletions, especially in the middle of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- 1D arrays provide O(1) access to elements but O(n) insertion/deletion in the middle.\n",
    "- 2D arrays (matrices) can be visualized as tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "- Various traversal patterns (row-major, column-major, diagonal, spiral) are useful for different types of problems.\n",
    "- Understanding array operations and their time complexities is crucial for efficient algorithm design.\n",

This understanding is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and choosing the right algorithm for a specific problem.\n",

    "Searching algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to find elements in data structures. Linear search is simple but inefficient for large datasets, while binary search is more efficient but requires the data to be sorted.\n",

    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- Linear search has O(n) time complexity and works on any data structure that can be traversed sequentially.\n",
    "- Binary search has O(log n) time complexity but requires the data to be sorted.\n",
    "- Binary search can be extended to solve various problems, such as finding the first/last occurrence, the closest element, or searching in a 2D matrix.\n",
    "- Binary search on answer is a powerful technique for solving optimization problems with a monotonic search space.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange a collection of items in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending order. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used in various applications, from databases to search algorithms. In this section, we'll explore different sorting algorithms, their implementations, and their time and space complexities.\n",

    "## Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms that works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.\n",

    "### Theoretical Foundation\n",

    "- **Basic Idea**: Repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) in the worst and average cases, O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as it only requires a constant amount of extra space.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a powerful programming technique that allows us to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar subproblems. It's particularly useful for problems with recursive structure, such as tree traversal, divide-and-conquer algorithms, and backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- Every recursive function must have at least one base case and at least one recursive case.\n",
    "- The call stack keeps track of function calls and their local variables.\n",
    "- Recursion can lead to stack overflow if the recursion depth is too large.\n",
    "- Memoization can significantly improve the performance of recursive functions by avoiding duplicate calculations.\n",
    "- Common recursion patterns include linear recursion, binary recursion, tail recursion, and backtracking.\n",
