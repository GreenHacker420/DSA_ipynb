    "\n",
    "Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start from the first element of the array.\n",
    "2. Compare the current element with the next element.\n",
    "3. If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.\n",
    "4. Move to the next element and repeat steps 2-3 until the end of the array.\n",
    "5. After one complete pass, the largest element will be at the end of the array.\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining elements (excluding the already sorted elements at the end).\n",

    "\n",
    "Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used in various applications. Each algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, most programming languages and libraries implement hybrid sorting algorithms that combine the strengths of different algorithms. For example, Python's `sorted()` function and the `sort()` method for lists use Timsort, which is a hybrid of merge sort and insertion sort.\n",
