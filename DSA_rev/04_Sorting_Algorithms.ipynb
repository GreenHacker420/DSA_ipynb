    "\n",
    "Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start from the first element of the array.\n",
    "2. Compare the current element with the next element.\n",
    "3. If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.\n",
    "4. Move to the next element and repeat steps 2-3 until the end of the array.\n",
    "5. After one complete pass, the largest element will be at the end of the array.\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining elements (excluding the already sorted elements at the end).\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting Sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that works well when the range of input values is not significantly larger than the number of elements to be sorted. It counts the occurrences of each element and uses this information to place the elements in their correct positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the range of input values (minimum and maximum).\n",
    "2. Create a counting array of size (max - min + 1) and initialize all elements to 0.\n",
    "3. Count the occurrences of each element in the input array and store them in the counting array.\n",
    "4. Modify the counting array to store the cumulative sum of counts.\n",
    "5. Create an output array of the same size as the input array.\n",
    "6. Place each element in its correct position in the output array using the counting array.\n",
