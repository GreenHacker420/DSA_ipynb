    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. It's particularly useful for optimization problems where we need to find the best solution among many possible solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind dynamic programming is to store the results of subproblems so that we don't have to recompute them when needed later. This technique, known as memoization, can significantly improve the efficiency of algorithms that would otherwise have exponential time complexity.\n",

For example, in the Fibonacci sequence, calculating F(5) requires calculating F(4) and F(3), calculating F(4) requires F(3) and F(2), and so on. Here, F(3) is calculated multiple times."

    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is a powerful technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. It's particularly useful for optimization problems where we need to find the best solution among many possible solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- Dynamic programming is applicable when a problem exhibits overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.\n",
    "- There are two main approaches to implementing dynamic programming: memoization (top-down) and tabulation (bottom-up).\n",
    "- Memoization is often easier to implement as it follows the natural recursive structure of the problem, but it may have overhead due to recursion.\n",
    "- Tabulation is generally faster due to lack of recursion, but it may require more careful thinking about the order of computation.\n",
    "- Common dynamic programming problems include the 0/1 Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence, and Coin Change.\n",
