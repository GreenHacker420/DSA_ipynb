    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to retrieve information from data structures. In this notebook, we explored three main searching techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Search**: The simplest searching algorithm with O(n) time complexity. It works by checking each element one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search**: A much more efficient algorithm for sorted arrays with O(log n) time complexity. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Binary Search on Answer**: A powerful technique for solving optimization problems. Instead of searching for a specific element, it searches for the optimal value in a range of possible answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific problem and constraints.\n",
