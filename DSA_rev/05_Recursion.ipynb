    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's a powerful approach for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. In this notebook, we'll explore the concept of recursion, its implementation, and various recursive patterns.\n",

    "# 1. Fundamental Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a method of solving problems where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. A recursive function calls itself with a smaller input, continuing until it reaches a base case that can be solved directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of a Recursive Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Every recursive function has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case(s)**: The simplest instance of the problem that can be solved directly without further recursion. This is crucial to prevent infinite recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Case(s)**: The part where the function calls itself with a simpler or smaller input, moving towards the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Recursion Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function calls itself, the current execution is paused, and a new instance of the function is created with the new parameters. This process continues until a base case is reached. Once the base case is solved, the results are passed back up the chain of recursive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Call Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in a program. When a function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the stack, containing the function's parameters and local variables. When the function returns, its frame is popped off the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recursion, each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. If there are too many recursive calls, it can lead to a stack overflow error.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  - Often leads to cleaner, more elegant code for certain problems.\n",
    "  - Natural fit for problems with recursive structures (e.g., tree traversal).\n",
    "  - Can be easier to understand for some problems.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "  - Can lead to stack overflow for deep recursion.\n",
    "  - Generally less efficient due to function call overhead.\n",
    "  - May use more memory due to the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  - Usually more efficient in terms of time and space.\n",
    "  - No risk of stack overflow.\n",
    "  - Often easier to optimize.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
